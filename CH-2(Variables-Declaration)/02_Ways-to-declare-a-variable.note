There are 3 styles of declaring/initializing variables

1>> By using Assignment operator  (inherited from C programming)
2>> By using Precise initializing 
3>> By using auto keyword (used only when DataType is unknown we let the compiler decide the DataType itself)

{
    C++14 standard from C++11 it is actually recommaned that you should initialize the variables by using Precise initializing instead of using Assignment operators because that propert is inherited from the C language 

}
